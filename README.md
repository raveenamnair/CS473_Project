# Steps for Module 1:
1. Open the file in Google Colab (preffered) or using Jupyter Notebook
2. Run the cells for Step 1. By the end of this, you should see a bunch of folders in your files sections. 
3. Navigate to TensorFlow -> workspace -> images and create two new folders named 'test' and 'train'. DO NOT CHANGE THESE NAMES
4. Inside of each, place a set of the labeled images in each. I put around 101 images in train and 49 in test
5. Continue running through each of the cells till you are done creating the model
6. To see if your model is done running, you will see a train folder created in Tensorflow -> workspace -> models -> erd_detection 
7. In this path, you will also see multiple checkpoint files made. You should see around 5 if you used 4000 steps to run model
8. To test, run the last few cells and see if the model worked well.
